Rather than providing a test-suite a parsed-expression printer is provided, since
the parsed-expression of a program could be quite large. Is up to the user to
check if parsing is ok or not.

To print the result of parsing in only one file execute the following command
in the current directory:

../../bin/parse filenamewithpath

where filenamewithpath is the complete path to the modelica file.

To print the result of parsing of every file in directory ../mccprograms:

./parse
